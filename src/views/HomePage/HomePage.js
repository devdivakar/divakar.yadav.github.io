    For example-  A customer bring 20 gm of gold and claims it's of 24 Carrot and which means it worth $1280 and the eligibile amount as per the lending algorithm let's say is $700.
    But after the quality inspection it eventually came out that it's 22 Carrot gold and the eligible amount is  $550 but the customer took out $700.
    Now to solve this problems we hired outsiders gold inspectors.
    Every time a new disbursal happens, it's assigned as a task to gold quality inspectors.
    Assigning this the quality inspector was done by a central assigner.`,chips: ['Back-End Web Development', 'Apache Kafka' , 'Python', 'MongoDB', 'Redis', 'Test Driven Development', 'Distributed Systems'] },
